# Sidebar Performance Improvements

The refactored sidebar components include several performance optimizations:

## 1. Memoization

- All child components are wrapped with `React.memo()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `useMemo` and `useCallback` are used for expensive computations and event handlers
- Navigation data is memoized based on relevant dependencies

## 2. Code Splitting

- Components are split into separate files, enabling better code splitting
- Custom hooks extract and isolate logic from UI components

## 3. Render Optimization

- Conditional rendering is used to only show components when needed
- The sidebar only renders its content when it's open or on desktop

## 4. Event Handling

- Event handlers use `useCallback` to maintain stable references
- `stopPropagation()` is used to prevent event bubbling where appropriate

## 5. Animation Performance

- Framer Motion animations use hardware acceleration where possible
- Transitions are kept short and efficient
- Only necessary properties are animated

## 6. State Management

- State is organized into custom hooks for better management
- Related state updates are grouped together
- State dependencies are properly tracked in effect hooks
