## Getting started
### Prerequisites
An actively running Appwrite instance. The instance can be a self-hosted installation or created using the Appwrite Cloud. For self-hosted installation instructions, refer to Appwrite's [self-hosting guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/self-hosting). To create an Appwrite Cloud account, visit [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/).

### Setup Instructions
1. Login to the Appwrite console:
Open a web browser and navigate to your Appwrite instance's URL. Login to the Appwrite console using your account credentials.

2. Create a project:
In the Appwrite console, create a project or select an existing project create an API key for the project:
Navigate to your project in the Appwrite console and find the "API Keys" section and create a new API key.
- Provide a name for the API key and choose the necessary permissions for your project.
- Give the API key access to the following scopes: users, databases, accounts, databases, and teams.

After creating the API key, make sure to copy and store the API key, project ID, and project endpoint in a .env file:
- Create a new file named .env in the root directory of your project and add the following lines to the .env file:
```dotenv
API_KEY=your-api-key
PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
PROJECT_ENDPOINT=your-project-endpoint
```
In the env file replace your-api-key, your-project-id, and your-project-endpoint with the actual values. 

**Note:**
- Keep the .env file secret, as it contains sensitive information.
- Use these variables exclusively under the server environment.

3. Run the shell script to set up the Appwrite database:
Execute the provided shell script to set up the Appwrite database. This script will create the necessary database and collections for Distributa.
Once the script completes execution, it will create the distributa database, invoices collection, and distributions collection in your Appwrite instance.
4. Set environment variables for React:
In your project's environment configuration file (e.g., .env.local or .env.development), add the following lines:
```dotenv
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=your-project-endpoint
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-distributa-database-id
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_INVOICES_COLLECTION_ID=your-invoices-collection-id
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DISTRIBUTIONS_COLLECTION_ID=your-distributions-collection-id
```
- Replace your-project-endpoint, your-distributa-database-id, your-invoices-collection-id, and your-distributions-collection-id with the actual values obtained from the previous steps.

Your database is now ready! Voil√†! Let's distribute:
With the configurations in place, you can use Distributa to distribute earnings, generate invoices, and perform other application-specific actions.
